I loved how poetic and nonlinear the narrative was and how the emotionless tone matched the family. This book is ripe with fantastic symbolism (especially with the banana company strike) and complex characters (ex. Colonel Aureliano Buendias). Marquez’s portrayal of the themes of memory, fate, and time as a cycle were very compelling as well. However, this was not an enjoyable book to read. It is very dense and pessimistic and there is so much incest or weird sex stuff that every chapter I would just be on the edge waiting for what messed up thing someone would do next.

"bschweiger","Feb 4, 2024",4,"I started reading this book more than 25 years ago and just could not get into. In fact, I still had the bookmark in it where I abandoned in that last attempt. I set out to read it again and struggled at the beginning. The only reason I persevered was because I chose this book for our book club. Part of what I found most difficult was the numerous characters with the same or similar names, and given that the story is not told in linear time, it was easy to confuse them. But as I got deeper into the story, I became more invested and found that I was enjoying it. It is the multi-generational story of the Buendía family, the patriarch of which, José Arcadio Buendía, founds the (fictional) town of Macondo, a rural Colombian village closer to the coast of the Caribbean than the Pacific. The village is visited by gypsies who bring the discoveries of the world beyond with them as they pass through periodically, exciting the imagination (and obsessions) of José Arcadio, whose wife, Úrsula Iguarán, puts up with his foolishness. Interestingly, the female figures in the book are the ones who more often than not show wisdom and sanity (although not all of them) and live the longest. I don't know if there is meant to be symbolism in the fantastical events, but over time I got used to the strange moments. I also struggled relating to or even caring about the characters, and yet the story still held my interest. While I read the first quarter of the book over a period of about three weeks - in part because I did not have a lot of free time, but also in part because I was struggling with it - I read the last nearly 300 pages in one day. Through his masterful storytelling, Gabriel García Márquez captured some key elements of Colombian history in the 20th century - how it affected the people in the more primitive and remote areas from guerilla warfare to the arrival of the railway, movies, telephones, cars, American (US) exploitation of natural resources (in this case, bananas), clashes between Liberals and Conservatives, the exploitation of plantation workers, who eventual go on strike and are later massacred - depending on whose version of history gets told and whose gets wiped out.

"awwarma","Jan 24, 2024",5,"Finally finished Cien Anos de Soledad. I read the English version translated by Gregory Rabassa. Some last lines of this novel has a melancholy effects on me. “Before reaching the final line, however, he had already understood that he would never leave that room, for it was foreseen that the city of mirrors (or mirages) would be wiped out by the wind and exiled from the memory of men at the precise moment when Aureliano Babilonia would finish deciphering the parchments, and that everything written on them was unrepeatable since time immemorial and forever more, because races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.”So their life was a curse, so their magical town was a curse, so there was nothing but a condemned life in Buendias family and their mad house was condemned too. The last line really has a dramatic effect on me, ‘races condemned to one hundred years of solitude did not have a second opportunity on earth.’ Like, I realized it then that after all, we’re all humans and we’re all condemned with our desolation, our solitude, and in the end, we’re nothing but a race that walk rights into our fear.The saddest part of Cien Anos de Soledad, I think, is the fact that time is cicling. Jose Arcadio Buendia killed Prudencio Agullar due to his lament joke about Jose Arcadio Buendia’s marriage. Meanwhile, Jose Arcadio Buendia still didn’t have a child because of Ursula Iguaran’s fear. His wife was scared with incest, with the certain truth of future about their marriage. Fear is an energy and it was transformed into rage which killed Prudencio Agullar. Yet the energy was still there, since the dead Prudencio Agullar was comically haunting Jose Arcadio Buendia. It then led them to ran away, finding Macondo. The irony of it was Jose Arcadio Buendia thought Macondo as Eden, yet it was only a sad and devastating sanctuary for him. He was cursed and his family was cursed since the day he killed Prudencio Agullar, and Ursula Iguaran was cursed and her family was cursed since the day she consummated her marriage. The fear and guilt they had had lasted them into the family with seven generations, yet life in fear was nothing and there’s no love in their life. The one who dare to loved was finally died alone, drowned in their solitudeness and desolation, yet the rest lived long enough with a solitude air between them. (  )","librarything"
"msf59","Jan 8, 2024",3,"I now understand why this sprawling (a major understatement), multi-generational novel is considered a literary classic. If I rated it strictly on ambition and scope it would earn an A+. It is dazzling in that respect. There is much to admire in these dense pages, as we follow the same family living in the small town of Macondo, tucked somewhere in South America. It is also an exhausting read and keeping track of the characters, many sharing the same or similar names grew tiresome at times, along with it’s repetitive narrative. That said, it will not be a novel I will soon forget and I still give it a solid rating but just be forewarned at the challenges ahead. (  )","librarything"

"ejerig","Oct 25, 2023",5,"This book is notoriously hard to get through in one go, and I completely understand why, but I somehow did not have this problem.Maybe it will make more sense if I explain the conditions under which I read this book. I had just taken a 10 hour bus ride from Oaxaca to Puerto Escondido, having spent five exhausting weeks teaching English in the city (yes, it really took 10 hours, yes that is way longer than it should have taken). Upon arriving at the beach, I discovered there was nothing to do that didn't cost a lot of money and involve sitting in the very hot sun. So, like any sane person, I spent nearly the entirety of my four days there holed up in my hotel room reading this book. Everyone else on the trip thought I had lost my mind; I would emerge at dinner time spewing nonsense about pig tails and banana revolts. The poor soul who found themselves seated next to me could only nod in fear as I whipped out my book and forced them to listen to a summary of what I had read for the day, gesturing at the family tree all the while. Only one other person on the trip had read it, and even she thought I was a little too obsessed. So yes, it is possible to read this book without getting stuck, but it will consume you if you are not careful.That being said, I understand why people struggle with it. The sentences are often the length of a normal paragraph and the paragraphs are pages long. On top of that, there are so many characters, and they all share pretty much the same four-ish names, so it can be hard to keep track of. When I described the plot to my coworker upon my return, I had to pull up a family tree so he would have any chance of following the story. If you can get through all of that (and it is possible), it is an extremely satisfying read. I wish I could read it again for the first time, if only to feel that same sense of accomplishment with every extremely long, twisted chapter I finished. (  )","librarything"
