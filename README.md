# What is the #SWDchallenge?

> The #SWDchallenge is a monthly challenge where you can practice and apply data visualization and storytelling skills. This is a safe space to try something new: test out a new tool, technique, or approach. You don't need to participate in one, a couple, or all. We encourage everyone to participate: all backgrounds, experience levels, and tools used are welcome. Each month has a different topic, announced at the beginning of the month. Participants have a week to find data, create and share their visual and related commentary. We're currently focusing mainly on different graph types, but sometimes change it up with a tip to try or a specific topic. This is a fun reason to flex your skills and share your creations.
> 
> All submissions received by the deadline are shared in a recap post later in the month.
